# Landing Page Project

This is a simple landing page project completed as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The objective was to recreate a web page design provided in the form of two images: one showcasing the full design and another highlighting the fonts and colors used.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The layout is built using CSS Flexbox, making it responsive and flexible across different screen sizes (though optimization for mobile devices was not a requirement).
- **Customizable Content:** The content on the page can be easily replaced with your own text and images. The project includes placeholder images and dummy text that can be swapped out as needed.
- **Simple and Clean Layout:** The design focuses on simplicity, following the guidelines provided, with a clear hierarchy of sections.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page, including the use of Flexbox for layout.
- **Google Fonts**: The project uses the "Roboto" font, as specified in the design.
